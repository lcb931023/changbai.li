Portfolio Template
=====

Portfolio Template built by a team of 5 RIT students. Kara Williams, Kaleigh Yang, Changbai Li, Jurian Hoff, Marco Fragale.

I'm currently in the process of converting this into a WordPress Theme, or use WordPress as backend for this.

How to use
=====

1. Follow the instructions in `/Template` folder to set up the workflow
2. For style changes, go to `src/sass`
3. For html markup changes, go to `src/htdocs`
4. Take all files in the `build` folder and put it at your root directory
